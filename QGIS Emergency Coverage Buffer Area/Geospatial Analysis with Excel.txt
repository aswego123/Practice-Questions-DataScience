Geospatial Analysis with Excel
You'll learn how to create a data-driven story about coffee shop coverage in Manhattan, covering:

Data Collection: Collect and scrape data for coffee shop locations and census population from various sources.
Data Processing: Use Python libraries like geopandas for merging population data with geographic maps.
Map Creation: Generate coverage maps using tools like QGIS and Excel to visualize coffee shop distribution and population impact.
Visualization: Create physical, Power BI, and video visualizations to present the data effectively.
Storytelling: Craft a narrative around coffee shop competition, including strategic insights and potential market changes.

Below are the **correct Excel steps** and the **final neighborhood with the largest population-per-store gap**.

# ✅ **Step-by-Step (Excel)**

### **1. Load the data**

* Open Excel → **Data → From Text/CSV**
* Import the table into a sheet.

### **2. Add Population_per_OurStore**

Insert a new column:

```
Population_per_OurStore = Population / Our_Stores
```

Calculate for each row.

### **3. (Optional) Add Coverage_Ratio**

```
Coverage_Ratio = Our_Stores / (Our_Stores + Competitor_Stores)
```

Useful for map visuals.

### **4. Sort descending**

Select the full table → **Sort → Sort by Population_per_OurStore → Largest to Smallest**

This reveals where MetroBeans is most under-served.

### **5. Map the hotspot (optional)**

Use:

* **Insert → Maps → Filled Map**
  or
* **Insert → 3D Maps**

Plot:

* **Population_per_OurStore**
* **Coverage_Ratio**

The top neighborhood should appear as the strongest unmet demand.

# ✅ **Quick Calculation**

Let's compute Population_per_OurStore:

| Neighborhood       | Population | Our_Stores | Pop per Our Store |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| Riverside          | 17615      | 1          | **17615**         |
| Northbank          | 9509       | 3          | 3169              |
| Lakeview           | 27703      | 2          | 13851             |
| Parkside           | 19700      | 1          | **19700**         |
| Hillcrest          | 21199      | 2          | 10600             |
| HarborPoint        | 19133      | 3          | 6378              |
| Cedar Grove        | 20415      | 3          | 6805              |
| Midtown            | 11519      | 2          | 5759              |
| Warehouse District | 25058      | 1          | **25058**         |
| Museum Quarter     | 24326      | 3          | 8108              |

# 🥇 **Largest population-per-store gap**

### **➡️ Warehouse District**

(25,058 people per store)

This is the neighborhood MetroBeans should prioritize for expansion.
